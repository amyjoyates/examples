Text in Numeric field
Fields left blank (null)
Very long numeric strings
Multiple decimals and commas (eg, "4..4" and "4,,434.4.4")
Boundary Value Analysis:
Lower Boundary
Lower Boundary - 1 (for decimal/float, use smaller amounts)
Upper Boundary
Upper Boundary + 1
Far below the lower boundary (eg, beyond the hardware boundary value)
Far above the upper boundary
middle of the range
0
0.0
White space, nothing else " "
String input & other incorrect data types.
Number with text in front or back, eg "$5.00", "4 lbs", "about 60", "50+"
Negative numbers
+ sign with positive numbers, "+4"
Both plus and minus sign, eg "+-4" and "-4e+30"
Exponents of 10, both uppercase and lowercase, positive and negative eg "4e10", "-5E-10", "+6e+60", etc
Too many "e" characters, eg "4e4e4" "4EE4"
Impossibly large/small exponents or inappropriate ones
Decimal values that cannot be represented in a computer
eg, .3 + .6 == 1.0? This bug affects most hardware, so outputs that compare decimal values should allow for a degree of error.
Integer/hardware overflow. eg, for 32-bit integers, what happens when adding 4 billion to 4 billion?
wrong use of decimal sign and thousands separator ("," vs. ".") (MikeD)
internationalization i18n issues: In english applications you write "12,345.67" meaning "12345.67" in german you write "12345,67" â€“ (k3b)
leading 0's don't make number octal (common javascript bug)
